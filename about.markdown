My name is Riley Wilson. I'm an undergraduate at UCLA hoping to pursue graduate school after a stint in the "real world." Academically, I'm interested in the Philosophy of Science. Talking about probability, the history of science, or so-called [minimal models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling%27s_model_of_segregation) of social phenomena can get me going. I'm also currently writing my undergraduate thesis on the [Fine-Tuning Argument](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fine-tuning/).

In college, I founded [Arist](https://www.arist.co/), a text-message-learning company with [Michael Ioffe](https://twitter.com/realioffe?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). I've transitioned into an advisor role, so it's been a while since I've thought about B2B software. Still, it's amazing to see a company grow. For a general sense of my professional activities, see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riley-w-b9081bb2/).
