My name is Riley Wilson. Here's a table of things I'm for, against, and on the fence about.

| For         | Against     | On the Fence |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| textures (all of them)      | non-textures (like glossiness)       | smell |
| odd numbers (they're strong)   | even numbers (they're weak)        | prime numbers (possibly overrated?) |
| looking just shitty enough | looking too nice | costly signals |
| blogs! | real-time online conversations | NYC |
| the efficient market hypothesis in the long-term | the efficient market hypothesis in the short-term | the efficient market hypothesis in the medium-term |
| high-quality quiet | TV | listening to podcasts |
| conformity | weirdos | lying |
| Riley | Rylie | Reilly |
| large lectures | small class sizes | small social environments |
| determinism about things | determinism about people | whether people are things |

Feel free to reach out â€” my email is [riley][wilson][1]@[protonmail].com. Maybe we can get coffee or just exchange emails on esoteric topics. The latter would allow me to fantasize that I'm in the Republic of Letters sans a 16th century standard of living.

I have a newsletter with my high-school cousin who's a budding leftist. We share links to what we've been reading every week. When something new appears on this blog, it will show up there. [Subscribe here](https://www.rereader.co/).
