title: Technique is destiny
---

Tennis is a beautiful sport, until you go to your local park. Then, it's flailing limbs in the general direction of a disobedient ball; it's clueless feet that are always too far from or too close to where they should be; it's elbow pain, biding its time.

To the average player, none of this matters. Tennis is fun, almost regardless of how you move your body. You can have a satisfying relationship with the game having never taken a tennis lesson in your life. Or, for that matter, taking a lesson and then doing the exact opposite of what a coach tells you. Snobs like me may frown, but you won't be arrested for tennis blasphemy. Infidels live happy lives in this sport.

The real problems arise if you want to get good. Tennis is a highly technical sport. Taking a racquet back like this or like that has career-defining consequences. A player can be oozing with athleticism, good sense, and work ethic, but with the wrong technique her level has been capped at the start. This is true at the professional and competitive recreational levels.  

I've written a little [elsewhere](link.com) about what constitutes correct and incorrect forehand technique. You can find plenty of resources online (though few of them good) about the correct way to hit backhands, serves, and volleys. My personal thoughts on technique closely track Hugh Clarke's. His writings comprise the best technical tennis instruction I've ever received, despite having received dozens of (expensive) private lessons.

However, this is not the place to discuss the biomechanics. I want to talk about the phenomenology of poor technique, or what it's like to have it. For professionals and amateurs so afflicted, it's deeply frustrating. Poor technique condemns you to a life of struggle and misery because it's almost invisible. Regular people have little awareness of how they move their bodies, and professional tennis players, almost paradoxically, often have even less. Roger Federer can't tell you his forehand grip, and David Nalbandian (though with a language barrier) can barely articulate what makes his own forehand effective. Most professionals solidified their strokes in their early teens and have not changed them, or thought hard about them, since. This means players often have little visibility into one of the largest determinants of their performance.

Such ignorance can wreak havoc on the psyche. When a stroke has proved unreliable in enough circumstances, and the cause is not obvious, players will blame the weather, luck, themselves, and God before resigning themselves. They begin to believe their backhand, for instance, just "sucks," and either accept this fate, or if they're stubborn, believe it's a matter of practice and retain high expectations for a compromised stroke. In both cases, they will dread the stroke in high pressure scenarios. When it fails them, they will feel betrayed, like their body suddenly isn't their own, or the tennis gods have cursed them with a glaring weakness on an otherwise spotless game. They sarcastically hope the gods are entertained while they curse and sputter after their stunted backhand is exploited on court.

[This reminds me of a dim recollection of Spinoza saying we're upset when we don't see the causes behind things. Or is it Lucretious? I don't remember, but I think something similar is happening here.]

The other side of cosmic victimization born from bad technique is the sense of control you get with good technique. Everything seems slightly easier, despite tennis being a hard game for anyone. The ball is more obedient, your opponents struggle slightly more against you, and your confidence increases. You can trust yourself on a tennis court again. If you didn't know any better, you'd think this was due to some sort of talent rather than subtle mechanical changes. In fact, you might ruminate talent of the traditional sort has something to do with what you went through. The talented just arrive at good technique quicker, and struggle less with the bad. 


Players with bad technique often don't know they have bad technique. They think their forehand or backhand is "bad" or "sucks,"

Consider Benoit Paire, a devilishly handsome frenchman with the [lushest](link.com) beard in tennis history and a penchant for popping his collar during professional matches. He is considered wildly talented with a world class backhand, serve, and touch. He is also emotionally volatile, and, for his ostensible talents, an underachiever.

A large part of this is because, I believe, his forehand is crap.[I want to check this. I should go on tennis abstract and look up forehand statistics and see how he compares. Maybe tennis TV has him ranked on forehand quality.] The details of why don't matter here, though, for the curious, I recommend reading Hugh Clarke on forehands and then viewing videos of Paire's.


What's important is to understand his forehand is a steaming pile of excrement smeared on an pristine player.
