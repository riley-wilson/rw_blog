title: Things I learned playing online poker (so far)
---

The first thing I learned from online poker is I'm bad at it. Almost comically so. Several times I've logged on, hoping to grind out a couple cents over a an hour, and immediately lost half my stack. I've doubled my money in one session, but lost enough to be down 15% overall. The graph of my poker winnings looks like a financial crisis in miniature.

Despite this, I think my poker situation is funny. I liken myself to a foreigner traveling to a new country and violating all the norms. I am scrumming when I should queue, bribing when I should bow, and using my American outdoor voice instead of a soft indoor one. I laugh when I see someone tromp all over the rules of engagement for my culture, and, in Pokerland, I am doing the tromping. What's even funnier is I don't know what norms I'm breaking. If I knew what good poker looked like, I'd be doing it. The only thing keying me into the dramatic irony is the money deducted from my balance at the end of a session.  

The second thing I learned is people, myself included, are more emotionally unstable than they believe. You could be correct in that you will never flip a chair or break a keyboard in anger, but tilt comes in different flavors. Insecure tilt rationalizes your bad breaks, saying of course you lost the hand — bad things always happen to you. Even if you get a good hand, you now believe you're doomed from the start. There's also a slow-burning tilt that comes after you think you've handled a loss gracefully. In the moment, you're a stoic, and part with your money in perfect equanimity. Little do you know your risk tolerance has subtly increased, and in five minutes you're playing hands you have no business in. There are many ways to get tilted, and you're probably only correct about a few.

The fourth thing I've learned is it's easier to rationalize your past decisions than seriously reflect. Probabilistic scenarios are ripe for this this sort of self-deception. Suppose you're dealt pocket aces in a heads-up scenario. Pretty good, right? Preflop, there's an 85% chance you win the hand. You know this and act like it. You preflop raise, call your opponent's reraise, and then call when your opponent goes all-in on the flop. Despite this, you lose the hand. It turns out your opponent flopped a full house, which has a .09% chance of happening conditional on a pocket pair. Did you make the right decision? In some sense, yes. Your odds were overwhelmingly favorable, so it's reasonable to get a lot of your money in the pot. [^1] The path of least resistance is to conclude you got unlucky and there's nothing to learn here.

Maybe this is true, but it's rarely the full picture. Imagine the same situation — pocket aces, a raise, re-raise, and all-in — but with additional information. Perhaps your opponent had never raised pre-flop before and only played premium hands. Perhaps they also, over many sessions, had never gone all-in. Now your hand doesn't look so good. Your opponent signaled they had a monster hand and you didn't listen. You could call this misfortune, but obliviousness is also at play. It's difficult to look past the high initial probability and see your own blunders.

[^1]: At least I think. Remember, I'm a bad poker player.
